## Procedure for Git

1. Create file in terminal.
2. Type `git init` to initialise.
3. `git status` tells you where you're at in the process.
4. `git add <file name>` to add file to stage, or `git add .` to add everything in current directory to stage.
5. `git commit -m"<message/label for commit>"` commits file to your machine along with a message description of the file.
6. `git log` = tells you what's been committed
7. Type `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "biancakendall29@gmail.com"` to generates an SSH key (no need to enter a password or file name in which to save it).
8. Navigate to the directory in which the SSH key was saved.
9. Type `cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub` to print the SSH key to the terminal (copy this key.)
10. Go to GitHub online and add a repository by clicking the plus button in the top right corner.
11. Paste the SSH key into new repository input and create key.
12. Choose the option "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line" and copy the corresponding code to clipboard and paste in the terminal to execute.
13. The file should then upload to the repository in the GitHub cloud.
